# UFOs
 
## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to make a website to help track all reports of UFOs or Extraterrestrials for anyone who wishes to track and sort the information.
 
## Results
The webpage is designed to show all the current sightings entered. The user can input a filter into one of the current 5 choices on the left side of the browser.

After you choose a filter. Enter the filter criteria appropriate for that filter and make sure you are using lower case for letters. Hit enter and the current data set should filter the data based on the user's search. Like below

## Summary
The biggest drawback of the website is the UFO sighting data must be updated manually. There is currently no automated program to collect all the available sightings but I recommend we plan on building one in the near future. I recommend we also update the code to handle upper case letters for better searches. Lasty, I recommend we include other countries in our information as there are sightings all over the globe.
